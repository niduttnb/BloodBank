# Blood-Management-System
In the present day, medical technologies is at itâ€™s peak. Most of the diseases are curable by a vaccine. It has become completely normal for a person to be in need of  blood. However it is found that many times when a person is in need of it, he doesn't have any means of finding it. Government  hospitals have particularly become very unorganized for the same. So, to solve the problem we intend to create a Blood Management System where a person who is in need of blood can receive it easily. Project Aim is to provide transparency in this field, make the process of obtaining blood from a blood bank hassle free and corruption free and make the system of blood management effective. We intend to remove the intermediate blood bank and create a website/forum that allows people in need of blood to get in direct contact with the donors.
